1. Run `npm install --save-dev npm-run-all` to install the `npm-run-all` package. This package lets us run multiple commands together (and more importantly it works on all operating systems). **Note:** I installed it as a devDependency using `--save-dev` because it's not needed to run the website. It's only needed for development.

2. Update package.json like this: https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/react-course/pull/78/files
